I tried to implement the skills I have learned so far during The Odin Project, including: 
- marking up text
- adding images
- formatting text
- using colors
- taking into account the box model
- layouts with flexbox

I also attempted to make this as responsive as possible with media queries and flexbox while still adhering to the design guidelines in terms of font-size, layout etc.
